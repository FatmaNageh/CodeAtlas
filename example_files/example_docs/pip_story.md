A tiny field mouse named **Pip** lived in a quiet corner of a bustling city park. He wasn't like the other mice; he wasn't interested in crumbs from picnics or the thrill of dodging feet. Pip was obsessed with the **moon**.

Every night, he would climb to the highest branch of the old oak tree, past the grumpy squirrel and the sleepy owl, just to gaze at the enormous, silver disc in the sky. To Pip, it looked like a perfect, round **cheese**.

One clear, cold night, a bright, reflective pebble caught his eye on the ground below. It was smooth, white, and perfectly round. Heart pounding with excitement, Pip scurried down the tree. He pushed, he rolled, he tugged, and finally, he managed to get the pebble back to his small burrow, nestled beneath the roots.

He nudged his "moon-cheese" into the darkest corner, where it shone with a faint, beautiful glow in the pitch black.

The next morning, the grumpy squirrel, who had seen the effort, asked, "Why did you bring that dull rock into your home, Pip? It's not food, you know."

Pip looked at his stone, then up at the sliver of moon still visible in the pale morning sky.

"It's not food," he squeaked happily, "but it's **mine**. And when the real moon is gone, I have a little piece of its light to keep me company."

From then on, Pip was known as the mouse with the small, bright moon. He learned that the greatest treasures are not always the ones you can eat, but the ones that bring **light** into your own tiny corner of the world.
